    Class to perform feature selection using the Information Gain method.

    Methods
    -------
    compute_correlation(feature, target_feature): Computes the value of the correlation
    feature_selection(train_dataframe, target_feature): Ranks the features according to their relevance for predicting
    the target

        SELECT K BEST ALGORITHM: Calculates the correlation between the feature and target feature using the Information
        Gain method. A value of 0 means that the features are independent, whereas a value
        of 1 means that knowledge of the featureâ€™s value strongly represents targetâ€™s value. Source
        of the code is: https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature.

        Parameters
        ----------
        feature (DataFrame column): Feature in the dataset
        target_feature (DataFrame column): Target feature of the dataset

        Returns
